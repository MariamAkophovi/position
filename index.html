    <h1>position: static;</h1>
    <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
        normal flow of the page:
    </p>

    <div class="static">
        This div element has position: static;
    </div>

    <h2>position: relative;</h2>
    <p>
        An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:
    </p>

    <div class="relative">
        This div element has position: relative;
    </div>

    <h3>position: fixed;</h3>

    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
        place even if the page is scrolled:
    </p>

    <div class="fixed">
        This div element has position: fixed;
    </div>

    <h4>position: absolute;</h4>
    <p>
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):
    </p>

    <div class="relative1">
        This div element has position: relative;
    </div>
    <div class="absolute">
        This div element has position: absolute;
    </div>

    <p>
        Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to understand how sticky positioning works.
    </p>

    <div class="sticky">
        I am sticky!
    </div>

    <div style="padding-bottom:2000px">
        <p>
            In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll
            position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.
        </p>
